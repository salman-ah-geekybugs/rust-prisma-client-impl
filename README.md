# Rust Prisma Client Implementation 

I was going through the documentation provided here, https://prisma.brendonovich.dev/introduction . And a lot of it was basically figure the rest of it yourself. So I thought I would try my hand at the implementation for the whole client. Although, I am thoroughly impressed by the Rust prisma client implementation, which can be easily used. I am by not a professional Rust programmer, I am newbie. Somehow I got this to work. I would like to work on this furthur to make things work probably. Who knows this thing might become huge! If anyone wants to contribute, I am very open to the idea.
